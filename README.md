This is the final project for Math 390: Data Science, taught by Professor Adam Kapelner at Queens College.


The model is based off of Queens Housing data from the 2016-17 fiscal years.

Housing_Model is the source code for the model. Running the entire script should work seamlessly.

Housing_Writeup.docx is the accompanying write up.

Housing_Presentation is the presentation-ready combination of the two.

Enjoy!
